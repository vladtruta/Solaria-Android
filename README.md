# Solaria-Android
This is the Android App for Project Solaria. This, along with the Web Application, 
are the software part of the whole system, which will allow the users to control 
their devices remotely.

Before seeing sensor values, you need to pair the device to the App. To do that,
you can either use Bluetooth Low Energy for a one-tap pairing solution, or manually
enter the system's Access Code (located on a sticker, on the actual Arduino chip).

The Solaria App makes it easy to monitor the status of all your hydroponic systems,
and also to get notified in case something goes wrong.
