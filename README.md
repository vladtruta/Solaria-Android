# Solaria-Android
This is the Android App for Project Solaria. This, along with the Web Application, 
comprise the software part of the whole kit; its purpose is to allow the users 
to monitor and control their devices remotely.

Before being able to control a system, you need to pair it to the App. To do that,
you can either use Bluetooth Low Energy for a one-tap pairing solution, or manually
enter the system's Access Code (located on a sticker, on the actual Arduino chip).

The Solaria App makes it easy to monitor the status of all your hydroponic systems,
and also to get notified in case something goes wrong.
